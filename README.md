# RestaurantsWebsite

AUTHOR:             Esther Osammor

PROJECT:            Assignment 4 of Comp 2406 course at Carleton University (Fundamentals of Web Applications) - restaurants website that allows users to register, login in, order food, set their profile privacy and view other user's profiles if they are public.

HOW TO RUN PROJECT: Ensure all files listed above are in the same directory, navigate to directory in terminal and input "npm install". This will install all the packages and                         modules required to run the project. Once this is complete, input "node database-initializer" to the terminal. this will initialize the database by clearing                       everything that was there before and populating it with the initial users. Once you see the success message, input "node server.js" This will start the server. 
                    Once it says, "server listening at..." open a browser and go to this link, "http://localhost:3000". You can then test the project. This link will also be                           displayed on the terminal console so you can copy and paste from there if preferred. Once done testing, press 'CTRL + C' to close the server. Thank you.
